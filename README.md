# Roomba Swarm!

## Introduction
This repo contains code relating to a side project I am working on, which involves taking a collection Roombas I have purchased from Goodwill and breathing new life into them as development platforms. Eventually I would like to use these for the development of various pathfinding and image recognition projects, but for now they are a fun side project! Besides, who doesn't want their very own fleet of Roombas?

## Hardware
This is an incomplete list, but I plan on completing it soon. definitely come back later!

### Electronics
- ESP32CAM (Generic Wrover module I picked up on Amazon)
- L298N H Bridge module (Also picked up on Amazon)

### Hardware
- IRobot Roomba 561 (Goodwill online auctions)
- 12V 7Ah Lead-Acid battery (From Lowes)

## Software
Currently written using Arduino, though eventually I would like to switch the sensor and motor control to a PIC platform (XC compiler, C).
